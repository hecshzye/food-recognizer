# food-recognizer
A full-stack machine learning app which tells you whether you have food in a photo.

## Update (2021/01/14)
- The computer vision model is overfitting and I am presently looking forward to solve issues with deployment.
- One of the main challenges whilst the deployment process presently is with tensorflow.js.
- Also, working on another cnn model using Django
- You can find practice notebooks in my repository "food-recognizer-model" or "food-or-not".
- Any sort of help or input in the making of the application is greatly appreciated. Thank you!
